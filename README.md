🚀 Real-Time Pathfinding Visualizer

A high-performance C++ + WebSocket powered pathfinding engine with modern real-time visualization using HTML-Canvas.

🔍 Overview

This is an end-to-end real-time pathfinding visualizer that streams algorithm progress directly from a C++ backend to a modern Web UI over WebSockets.

It supports BFS, Dijkstra, and A* with:

Live animation

Adjustable speed

Dynamic coloring of visited nodes & final shortest path

This tool is ideal for:
✔ Algorithm visualization
✔ Educational demos
✔ System-design understanding
✔ Research experiments
