# 🚀 Real-Time Pathfinding Visualizer

A high-performance **C++ + WebSocket** powered pathfinding engine with modern real-time visualization using **HTML Canvas**.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project is an end-to-end real-time pathfinding visualizer that streams algorithm progress directly from a **C++ backend** to a modern **Web UI** using WebSockets.

It supports **BFS**, **Dijkstra**, and **A\*** with:

- Live animated exploration  
- Adjustable speed  
- Dynamic coloring of visited nodes  
- Highlighted final shortest path  

This tool is ideal for:  
✔ Algorithm visualization  
✔ Educational demos  
✔ System design understanding  
✔ Research experiments
