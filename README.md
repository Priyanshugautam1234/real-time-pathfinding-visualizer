🚀 Real-Time Pathfinding Visualizer
A high-performance C++ + WebSocket powered pathfinding engine with modern real-time visualization in HTML-Canvas.

📌 Overview
This project is an end-to-end real-time pathfinding visualizer that streams algorithm progress directly from a C++ backend to a modern Web UI using WebSockets.
It supports BFS, Dijkstra, and A* with live animation, adjustable speed, and dynamic coloring of visited nodes & shortest paths.

This tool is ideal for:
✔ Algorithm visualization
✔ Educational demos
✔ System design understanding
✔ Research experiments
